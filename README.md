connector ETL file...
handles challenges like irregular schemas, transforming date formats while accounting for leap years, and converting nested data into a clean, consumable structure.

Leap Year Validation:

Ensures February 29th is valid only in leap years.
Throws an error for invalid dates, such as "20210229".
Dynamic Date Parsing:

Supports multiple date formats (YYYYMMDD, MM-DD-YYYY, Month DD YYYY).
Converts all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).
Expense Data Transformation:

Parses and flattens JSON-like data from the expense_details column.
Handles missing fields gracefully (e.g., defaulting category to "Unknown").
Error Handling:

Logs and skips invalid rows without halting the entire transformation process.
Database Integration:

Fetches raw data from the SAP Concur database.
Uses PostgreSQL for querying.
